# Writing better code

Fundamentally, one of the most important things when you are learning to write more effective code is learning to write better code. What do I mean by "better"? When I say "better", I mean code that is:

- **Easily maintainable** - Your code should be written in such a way that future development on your project doesn't require massive changes, and what bugs you leave in should be relatively easy to find and remove.
- **Easily usable** - Your code needs to be designed in a way where any other programmer on your team can pick it up and use it. This means you need to write effective documentation, include *helpful* comments, and, most importantly, simply write code that describes itself.
- **Extensible** - While not always a requirement, especially if your project has a very narrow scope and you can be completely sure it will never have to expand, software (especially in a library) needs to be written to be easily extended with minimal or preferably no modification to the base code.

With that in mind, this section of the book will focus on improving the quality of your code.
