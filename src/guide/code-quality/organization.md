Organization is critical to code structure. Different parts of your code need to go in different files so they can make sense. This is actually a big reason why Java is such a great language to learn; Java almost forces you to organize things into different directories. However, in Vex we mostly use C++, so lets look at a few of the tools C++ gives us to work with.
