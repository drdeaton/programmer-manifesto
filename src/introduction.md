# Introduction

Howdy! My name is Drew Deaton. I competed in Vex Robotics for 12 years, including 3 years leading software for my high school organization and another 3 years as the software lead for Aggie Robotics, leading development of ReveilLib. More importantly than all of that, though, I am the loudest and the proudest member of the Fightin' Texas Aggie Class of 2025. Over these years, I've seen the Vex programming landscape shift massively, and I've seen what works, and I've seen what doesn't. In this book, I will attempt to pass on that knowledge, so the next generation of Aggie Robotics programmers can do what I couldn't and BTHO WORLDS!
